## Notes

### What's Unity?

- It's a game engine. Unreal is another very popular game engine too.
- It's a visual interface for creating games.
- Has systems of existing code we can use.
  - For example, a physics system, rendering system, audio system, etc.
  - Systems give you a headstart in game development as you don't have to code things like physics from scratch.

### What's Unity Hub?

- A place where you can:
  - Manage all your projects
  - See all the versions of Unity you've got installed

### What's WebGL Build Support?

It lets your games be playable on a website.

### What's Visual Studio (VS Code)?

- It's an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- It lets us write code to tell the game engine what to do.
  - We'll be creating `.cs` files that will tell Unity what to do.
- Has helpful features whilst you develop, such as auto-complete, colour coding, syntax error checking, etc.
